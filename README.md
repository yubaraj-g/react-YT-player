# React + Vite

<!-- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. -->

NOTE: This custom video player is integrated with <b>Youtube Data API v3</b> and <b>Rapid YT to MP4 API</b>

1. Please <code>npm i</code> to install all the dependencies.
2. Please check for the <code>.env</code> file for any API issues.
NOTE: (This is my personal Youtube API and Rapid API auth keys, please don't abuse or misuse. It has limited query requests per day)
3. Please run <code>npm run dev</code> for local run in development mode.
4. Please run <code>npm run build</code>, if you want to make a production build.
5. Please run <code>npm run preview</code> for running the production build.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
